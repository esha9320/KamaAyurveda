            <p>My typographic selecction inclde <span>Adobe Garamond Pro</span> and <span>Interface</span>.Adobe Garamond Pro is widely used for its exceptional readability, but at the same takes up less space than other fonts. Its italic form is known to accentuate its pleasing curves without being garish. Garamond is altogether a more pleasant font for the eyes, and lends a human character to the shape of the written word. InterFace was inspired by sans serif fonts of the 19th Century, subtly blended with humanist details for a softer look. From screen to signage, InterFace carries any message with flawless precision.</p>
